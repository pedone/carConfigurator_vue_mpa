# Introduction 
Car Configurator was a learning project as an introduction to asp.net.
I used ASP.NET MVC for the backend, Vuejs for client side, SQL Server for the database and bootstrap and less for a simple UI.
The website is build with responsive design using the built-in bootstrap classes.

This is a fork based on the carConfigurator repository.
The difference to the original repo is the use of Vuejs for building a multi page application.
In addition to the technologies above, I used gulp with babel and browserify for bundling and minifying all javascript files per page and loading just the bundle in the page.
